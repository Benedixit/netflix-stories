# netflix-stories

The dataset used for this project was obtained from project done by Chase Willden on https://data.world/chasewillden/netflix-shows. Data duplicates were removed and the cleaned data was stored into a temporary table. Subsequently, SQL queries were carried out to provide answers to the following:
1.	Number of movies for each rating
2.	Number of movies for every year
3.	Top 10 movies with the highest rating score
4.	Distribution of movies every year with ratings
5.	Average user rating score for each movie rating
6.	Total number of movies in the database
7.	Average user rating
